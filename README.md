Random Telegram Bot created using Github Copilot (and chatGPT). yes, I don't code on this repo

This bot is simply taking a string as a parameter, then return all its anagrams from Anagramica API

To make this work just add config.json file and put your telegram bot token there, like this -->

`{
    "telegram_bot_token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
}`
